🌈 CalmConnect – A Supportive Web Platform
📌 About the Project

CalmConnect is a thoughtfully designed web application created to support autistic children in their daily lives.
The platform focuses on emotional regulation, routine building, and calming activities through simple and engaging features.

This project aims to create a safe, comforting, and easy-to-use digital space for children who benefit from structured routines and calming interactions.
I am currently working on this project so it will take some sometime to get the propoer output which i imagined but this is the topic on whch i am working on and want to make an app for autistic people.
